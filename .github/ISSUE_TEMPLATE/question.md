- [ ] I have verified there are no duplicate open or recent questions.
- [ ] I have read over the documentation, checked out the examples and the demo app.
- [ ] I have given my issue a non-generic title.
- [ ] I understand that if I ask the same question in [stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) website I will get answers way faster as more people will try to answer it.
- [ ] I understand that if I don't show a minimum effort of what I have tried and where I got stuck the question will be closed and marked as invalid.
- [ ] I have read the article [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- [ ] I understand that this library is a custom [Adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter.html) and **NOT** a custom [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html). I understand the difference between them and what is possible to be done in an Adapter but not in a RecyclerView.
