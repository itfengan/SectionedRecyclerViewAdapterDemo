- [ ] I understand that this library is a custom [Adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter.html) and **NOT** a custom [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html). I understand the difference between them and what is possible to be done in an Adapter but not in a RecyclerView.
